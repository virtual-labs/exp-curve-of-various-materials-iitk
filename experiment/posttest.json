      "question": "1. Which is true for uniaxial tensile engineering stress-strain curve of a polycrystalline aluminum?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The curve goes up till yield point and then goes down till fracture",
        "b": "Yield strength is higher than ultimate tensile strength",
        "c": "The sample fractures before necking",
        "d": "The maximum stress is called ultimate tensile strength"
